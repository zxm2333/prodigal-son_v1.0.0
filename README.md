## ✝️ Story & Theme

This game is inspired by the Biblical parable of **the Prodigal Son**.

The player takes the role of a prodigal who leaves his father's house and enters a hostile world.
Along the journey, he must confront personified sins and inner struggles, including:

- **Pride**
- **Envy**
- **Greed**
- (and others)

Each enemy represents a moral challenge rather than a purely physical threat.

The final boss symbolizes the ultimate confrontation before repentance and return.
